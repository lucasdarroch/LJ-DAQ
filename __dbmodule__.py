# DATA


def csv_to_json(abs_file_path, json_file_path):

    Converts the CSV of data to a JSON file with the intention of writing the JSON directly to the
    desired database.

    First, os checks that `csv_file_path` exists. If not, an error code is returned. If it does, the
    csv file is opened and each row is turned into a python dictionary as an intermediary step. The
    id of each document is set to be the same as the timestamp, and the dictionaries are converted to
    a JSON file which is named `json_file_path` and added to the project folder.


    Parameters
    ----------
    self.data_file_path: str
        The name of the csv file containing the data in the project folder.
    self.json_file_path : str
        The name to assign to the data once it's been converted from csv to json
        (The default is 'west_island_update.json')
    Returns
    -------
    int

    -----
    Even though `csv_file_path` and `json_file_path` are called paths, they're names of files.
